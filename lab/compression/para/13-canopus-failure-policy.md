### Failure Policy

Subsystem initialization failures (WASAPI device unavailable, DX12 device creation failure, etc.) are reported to the user and the application exits cleanly with a diagnostic message (via logging if available, otherwise stderr/message box).

Runtime failures trigger a clean shutdown. The application does not attempt hot recovery; the user restarts. This is acceptable for a calibration utility that is not a long-running service.
